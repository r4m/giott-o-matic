Giott-o-matic
=======


Giott-o-matic is a rescue robot that follows a white line and autonomously detects and extinguishs a fire. It has been developed for the IEEE Student Branch Region 8 contest in 2006 by the IEESB of the [Department of Information Engineering](http://www.dei.unipd.it/wdyn/index.php?lingua=en). Giott-o-matic was hacked together by [Saverio Bolognani](http://www.dei.unipd.it/~sbologna/), [Nicola Trivellin](http://it.linkedin.com/pub/nicola-trivellin/67/b5/65), [Daniele Beninato](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dbeninato) and [me](www.filippozanella.com). Our team won the prize for the best robot design.

The source code collects the line-follower algorithm (a fuzzy controller), and the procedure to extinguish the fire (via infrared sensors and a nebulizer).
